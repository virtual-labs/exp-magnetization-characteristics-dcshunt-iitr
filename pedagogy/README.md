#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 The simulator has a package of lab equipments like voltmeter, ammeters, rheostat, and wires. Firstly, the user has to understand the equivalent circuit of experiments and make proper connections to complete the circuit as per the given instructions. After the right connection, the user can ready to take reading from ammeter, voltmeter to observe the output values of current and voltage. These observation readings are used to plot the characteristics as per the requirement of experiments.
